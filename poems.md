## Black

**Black**

each day the image of a  
distorted piece of art  
digs deeper,  
deeper,  
so  
deep into my mind  
i question that if i ever find the original,  
will i ever reach the surface?  
the painfully distorted portrait is  
painted into the damaged walls above my shoulders.  
The painting is awful, but I am trapped.  
my eyes are chained to this work of art.  
chained to it’s beautifully crafted imperfections.  
i need to fix it.  
ive tried to fix it,  
but nothing works.  
thousands of hours ive spent  
reworking this mural.  
over  
and over  
and over again,  
to wake and find a fresh layer of paint,  
covering the spots i fixed  
i wish that this painting would  
find an empty wall in the lourve,  
one that i would stop,  
take a photo at,  
marvel at for hours,  
and share with others.  
i will paint  
the canvas black today,  
so that my tired eyes can rest.

## Speaking with Touch

**Speaking with Touch**

The moonlight pours over  
Our lovers and wraps them tight,  
Like a mother who wishes  
love for Her children  
would do at night.

Our lovers speak in secrets  
With their fingertips  
And feel emotion through  
Each other’s lips.

Gentle fingers twirl and knead  
Through his brown strands  
As the woman cradles the mans head,  
Knowing that she is his world,  
And He is hers

As the moments pass,  
Our two lovers feel  
The Fire for one another  
Getting hotter  
And hotter  
Until its too hot  
And the moon goes down  
and sun comes up.
